Thanks for the amazing suggestions / questions on my previous post.
Here () i am adding an Angular Frontend to the application, hosting it on an S3 bucket and creating a CloudFront Layer on top of S3. Summarizing:
The Presentation Tier is built with Angular and hosted on S3, with CloudFront distribution on top of S3
The Application Tier consists of API Gateway that accepts the input from the Presentation Tier, passes it on to SQS queue, lambda and invokes machine learning models hosted on Kubernetes cluster.
The Data Tier is MySQL DB that stores the predictions by the ML models for the given user input

We have used Web Application Firewall (WAF), Config Rules, Certificates from Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM), Amazon Inspector to secure the application.
S3 Standard + CDN (for Frontend), ALB, Multi-AZ DB are used to ensure high availability.
Also, the steps to ensure cross-region Disaster Recovery (DR) are provided.

Please DM your valuable questions / suggestions as usual !
