1. Go to Amazon Inspector and specify your account ID for delegated administrator account and activate the trial.

2. Check the vulnerability findings for the EC2 instances, lambda functions and ECR repositories.

I could find package vulnerabilties like "CVE-2023-6597 - python3-libs, python3", "CVE-2024-26584 - kernel-headers, kernel-devel and 1 more"

network vulnerabilties like "Port 22 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP" in the EC2 instances.
