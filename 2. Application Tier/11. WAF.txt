In Console, Go to WAF & Shield.

## Create an AWS WAF WebACL

1. Create a WebACL

Name: MyWebACL
Resource type: Regional Resources (ALBs, REST APIs etc)
Associated resources: select the ALB

2. Create own rule for the WebACL

Name: Rate100
Type: Rate-based rule
Rate limit: 100
Action: Block

3. Use the following command on CloudShell to trip the WAF rule (modify the domain name)
for i in {1..140}; do curl https://mlapps.tekedify.net; done
This did not work me in Cloudshell. I provisioned an EC2 instance and there i could simulate the error.
Initially i got the "health check completed succssfully message" but after rate exceeded, i got "403 Forbidden error".

There are a lot of managed rules like:
Account takeover prevention
Account creation fraud prevention
Bot Control
Known bad inputs
Anonymous IP list etc.

Ideally this step is not needed as user will have access only to the Frontend and no direct access to ALB.
